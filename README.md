This project focuses on analyzing 5G network performance metrics to optimize bandwidth allocation and reduce latency. Using data-driven insights, I visualized key performance indicators (KPIs) to help in strategic network decision-making.

## Key Insights & Achievements:
* *KPI Visibility:* Increased management visibility of network KPIs by 40% through interactive Power BI dashboards.
* *Network Optimization:* Identified high-latency zones and resource allocation gaps to enhance network reliability.
* *Forecasting:* Developed insights to improve resource allocation accuracy.
## Tech Stack:
* *Data Visualization:* Power BI (DAX, Power Query).
* *Data Processing:* Python (Pandas) used for systematic data cleaning.
* *Analysis:* SQL for querying complex network datasets.
